## Project Descripton
My project seeks to utilize different technologies in the creation of a movie review website, to evaluate which technologies are best suited for this. This resulting app will be a web-based application that will include a homepage, as a landing page, and an about page, which informs users about the website. It will allow users to login and out of the application. For users who do not have an account the application will have a create account section. The application will allow users to browse through all the articles available. The application will allow users to interact with the article by allowing users to comment on a given article
